# Jet
I was able to upload all files with Git LFS. It now will work, but you will have to rename any files that have "Jet-" to say "Jet!".

## Instructions to download
Download the zip file from the repository.

Extract all contents.

Rename `Jet-_Data` to `Jet!_data`

Start the exe file.

## Notes
Unfortunately, some textures weren't able to upload including the airplane textures.

## Credits
- Unity for some assets and for the Unity editor.
